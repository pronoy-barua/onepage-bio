            For the past 2.5 years, I have been working as a Video Systems Engineer at Qualcomm. It has been a challenging and enriching experience. I have independently owned a chipsetâ€™s video subsystem from inception to commercialization. It increased my exposure and knowledge of the video subsystem and the adjacent subsystems with which it interacts. The role demands domain expertise and fluent communication with multiple teams like hardware, driver, clocks, and more.

           In the past, I have deliberately sought to gain exposure across multiple levels of abstraction in computing - including but not limited to the domains of Web Development, Machine Learning, and Systems Engineering. 
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
